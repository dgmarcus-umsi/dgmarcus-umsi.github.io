      <h2 class="portfolio-text">What</h2>
      <p class="portfolio-text">Three months into the COVID-19 pandemic, my girlfriend asked me if I would help design a website for her parents’ business, Kristoffer’s Cafe and Bakery, a local favorite in Chicago’s Pilsen neighborhood known widely for their delicious tres leche cakes. Luis and Martha Figueroa knew the cafe needed a website to facilitate online ordering, and they needed the launch to coincide with their reopening. In addition to a website, they wanted a fresher logo, and of course designing the website would imply the invention of a digital style and brand. The website needed to help people find the cafe, empower them to order online, convey the same feelings as the physical Kristoffer’s Cafe, showcase delicious product, and be designed mobile first, since most folks would likely be accessing the website form their smartphones.</p>
      <h2 class="portfolio-text">How</h2>
      <p class="portfolio-text">Given the circumstance Squarespace seemed like the best tool for this job. I knew it would allow us to start with a blank canvas and feel our way through the project, which is just what we did. It also allowed us to take the website from 0 to live within the tight two week turnaround required. By making a change, asking ourselves if it felt right—if it felt like the best way to arrange the information, to style the text, the backgrounds, the colors; if it felt like Kristoffer’s—and building the site together one piece at a time, we created a place imbued with the same spirit and cozy magic of Kristoffer’s Cafe on Halsted St.</p>
      <h2 class="portfolio-text">Why</h2>
      <p class="portfolio-text">The complexity inherent in this project, for the most part, didn’t lie in the realm of usability or findability or taxonomy. We could predict customers’ needs without turning to research. We just asked ourselves what would be most important to us if we were customers: finding the place, the menu, seeing images of the food and cakes, reviews, and so on. Rather, getting the feeling right was the most complex part of this project. Kristoffer’s digital place had to feel like the physical one, had to have the same personality, the same vibe and the same signature, while adding meaning to both places with information and the presentation of said information. For example, we decided to include “Our Story” sections in both English and Spanish, not just to support the needs of the cafe’s Spanish-speaking customers, but also to give additional depth to the place by being true to heritage. From top to bottom, we tried to make the place feel like Kristoffer’s. The Menu page of the site, however, did present semantic, stylistic, and informatic complexity. After all, the way we arranged the content in the menu would give it new meaning! Much thinking went into the question of how to design the menu to support ease of use and information-seeking behavior. Transcending a menu that looks fine on a large .pdf to one that works well in a web browser was effortful, but by iterating toward what felt the most manageable, understandable and right, we created a menu that renders things clear.</p>
