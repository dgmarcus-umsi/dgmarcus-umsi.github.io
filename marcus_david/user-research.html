      <h2 class="portfolio-text">What</h2>
      <p class="portfolio-text">In the midst of creating an e-commerce store, one of the world’s biggest software companies partnered with my UMSI SI 622 Needs Assessment and Usability Evaluations team. To ensure the digital place met the needs of customers, our nonhierarchical team of 4 grad students conducted a semester’s worth of user research. To ensure our research captured well-rounded insights into the digital place and its future visitors, our research entailed both qualitative and quantitative methods, plus marketing research to contextualize our insights.</p>
      <h2 class="portfolio-text">How</h2>
      <p class="portfolio-text">To bring ourselves up to speed on the project, our team began by meeting with stakeholders. We exchanged information: they told us about their project, we told them about our human-centered process. Once we were on the same page, our team took a deep dive into the experiences of users of parallel products (since our e-commerce store was not yet “live”). This entailed 4 remote interviews with applicable folks of various backgrounds. After completing our interviews, we coded our transcripts, extracted our insights, captured them on post-it notes, and arranged them into a ginormous affinity wall, from which we derived key findings about the needs of our interviewees; findings which informed the resulting personas and scenarios. All of this—the interviews, insights derived from affinity walls, personas, scenarios, plus a sitemap we made to explore and understand the digital place—were distilled into a huge report we delivered to our stakeholders. To better understand the market our project would be launched in, as well as to steal the good ideas of competitors and avoid their pitfalls, our team conducted a comparative analysis of 7 other e-commerce stores similar to our own. Simultaneously, we designed and released a survey to capture and analyze some quantitative insights into the needs of potential customers. By basing our questions on the user needs and pain points drawn from our user interviews, we captured compelling and specific ways to improve the high-level design of the product. Just like before, lengthy reports of our comparative and survey analysis were shared with project stakeholders. At this point we had thoroughly explored the goals, needs, and pain points of customers our product would go after. Now it was time to zoom into the prototype itself and figure out how to improve its design to better satisfy those goals and needs. Before conducting prototype validations with potential users, we conducted a heuristics evaluation of the prototype using Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design. Every team member completed an evaluation before compiling their results with the rest of the team and distilling our insights into a report full of action items. Finally it was time for the most fun part of the project: usability tests with potential users. After devising a series of tasks meant to address key workflows of the prototype, our team recruited users befitting our personas and conducted five remote usability tests. After holding interpretation sessions, we recorded and ranked by importance a myriad of ways to improve the usability of the prototype.</p>
      <h2 class="portfolio-text">Why</h2>
      <p class="portfolio-text">Each layer, each round of research gave context to subsequent rounds and depth to our findings, all of which we connected to and supported with data from across research phases. By beginning with discovering the needs of potential customers, we were later able to identify which usability flaws were most critical and why. Thus we discovered truths about where users would be most likely to encounter problems with the e-commerce store, why and how those problems would affect them, and the best, most straightforward and backed-by-research ways of solving them.</p>
