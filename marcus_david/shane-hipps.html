      <h2 class="portfolio-text">What</h2>
      <p class="portfolio-text">Shane Hipps, Fortune 50 Leadership Coach and best-selling author, needed a new website to anchor and channel his evolving brand. Given 2 fonts, 4 grayscale colors, and a logo, I was tasked with designing Shane’s digital place--one that established his credibility, familiarized visitors with his brand and message, led users toward Calls To Action, and housed his professional blog. We needed a bold digital style unique from others in the professional leadership space, and it had to look good on mobile, so when someone says “check out Shane Hipps,” the visitor loading the website on their smartphone is instantly impressed and interested. This needed to be Shane Hipps’ place, so tangibly digital that it would almost feel physical.</p>
      <h2 class="portfolio-text">How</h2>
      <p class="portfolio-text">Before picking up a pencil, I visited the websites of others in the professional leadership space. In doing so I discovered a powerful insight: most websites in the space, such as that of Simon Sinek, focus on products instead of the thought leader. Shane and I agreed to have it the other way around: focus on the person—the long-term selling point—not the products.With this insight in mind, I set out to design a bold digital place centered around Shane and his expertise. The workflow entailed sketching, getting feedback from Shane, translating the sketches into Squarespace, getting Shane’s feedback once more, and continuing to tweak. As I worked with Shane, I learned that he was a detail-oriented and demanding client in the best of ways. He wanted to be involved throughout the project and I could not have appreciated his input more. Building the site in Squarespace, I was able to iteratively design toward what felt most authentic and best, gradually crafting the place, its content, and its style.</p>
      <h2 class="portfolio-text">Why</h2>
      <p class="portfolio-text">I spent a lot of time working on the homepage of shanehipps.com, since it offered the make it or break it shot at establishing Shane’s credibility. The underlying goal of the place was to get visitors to work with Shane, and that wouldn’t happen without trust. So we showcased Shane’s clients near the top of the homepage, and paired them with an impressive background video of Shane speaking at a well-attended event. To place Shane at the center of his site I dedicated a section of the homepage to introducing Shane. And whenever Shane’s talked about, testimonials immediately follow, thereby backing up his name, brand, and message.Every time I designed something for the site, I asked myself if it felt right, if it belonged in the place I was building, if it conveyed the message of Shane being a talented leadership coach and industry-defining figure. From top to bottom, the site needed to harmonize with this message. That meant custom designing and pixel-tweaking many of the site’s components, like the testimonial cards I created for the Home, About Shane, and Work With Shane pages. It also meant going with simple, bold, black and white designs that let the bright orange Call To Action buttons catch eyes. Designing content to be readable, dynamic, and with all roads pointing toward working with Shane. </p>
