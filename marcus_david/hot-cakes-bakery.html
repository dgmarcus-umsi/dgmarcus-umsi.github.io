      <h2 class="portfolio-text">What</h2>
      <p class="portfolio-text">Hot Cakes Bakery’s old digital place consisted of a few short web pages. Between them they featured some text about the bakery, 4 images of product that looked like buttons but weren’t, and many pitfalls of usability, visual, and interaction design. But more than anything, Hot Cakes’ old site didn’t support the needs of its visitors. Even basic product information was not there to be found. A complete redesign was in order; one that would give Hot Cakes not just a website, but a digital place that served as an extension of and felt like the Bakery itself. </p>
      <h2 class="portfolio-text">How</h2>
      <p class="portfolio-text">Before talking about or drawing out ideas, I conducted a heuristic evaluation and a few informal usability tests on Hot Cakes’ old site. That way I gathered low-hanging ways of improving the place, and got to hear folks’ thoughts on how the place succeeded or let them down. Throughout this research and conversations with the bakery owner, I realized there were three main groups of folks the website would have to support: big-grocery-chain product managers, small-business food store owners, and everyday Joes and Jans who find Hot Cakes products at their grocery store and want to learn more.I brought these insights with me into my ideation phase. Iteratively sketching the structural design of the new place into existence, I ensured the needs of the three user groups would be fulfilled. Once everything was sketched and approved by the Bakery Owner, I constructed and tweaked the designs in Squarespace. </p>
      <h2 class="portfolio-text">Why</h2>
      <p class="portfolio-text">To meet the needs of users, I designed the new hotcakesbakery.com to be much more product-focused than the old site. That meant creating a well-organized and browsable product directory, including lots of images of delicious baked goods, and offering users an easy-to-use contact form. On top of the structural design, styling hotcakesbakery.com so that it felt like Hot Cakes presented a challenge. Bakeries traditionally feel homely, which is rarely the the case for software. Yet the website also had to convey the impression of a company capable of meeting the needs of nationwide grocery chains. Striking the balance between those forces—professional scalability and homeliness—in the end proved to be the most labor-intensive and fun part of the project, which concluded with the deployment of a place that meets the needs of both the Bakery and its customers.</p>
